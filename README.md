- Hello! I’m Sparsh Jha

- I’m interested in Hardware design, Kernel and OS development, and Cyber security

- I’m currently working on learning C, Linux, memory hierarchy and design, CPU design, pipelining, and multiprocessor architectures.

- I'm proficient in Python, C++, Java, HTML, MIPS and Verilog

- I am also working in multiple projects which deal with how CPU works, 

  and how programming languages handle memory alongside the OS and processor.

- While I am not looking for collaborations actively feel free to contact me if you are interested in doing so!
